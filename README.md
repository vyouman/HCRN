# HCRN
PyTorch implementation of Hourglass-shaped Convolutional Recurrent Network (HCRN) described in our paper "Towards Modeling Auditory Restoration in Noisy Environments"

# Requirements
Pytorch＝0.4.1  
resampy  
soundfile   
pysepq  
librosa  
pystoi
lera

# Data Preparation
Use the scripts in preprocess to process the WSJ, ESC-50 and Audioset datasets. Please modify the dataset paths in the scripts.

# Train and test
For training:  python3 Train.py

For testing:  pytho3 Test.py

Please modify specify processed dataset paths in config.yaml.
